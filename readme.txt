A simple content freeze plugin to make coordinating with clients, other co-workers or teams much easier.

== Description ==

This plugin is intended to alert your clients or users that there is a content freeze in progress and no changes can be made to the website or work will be lost.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When a content freeze is active, will users have the ability to make any chances to the site? =

No, only the admin account you select while enabling the content freeze will be able to make any changes, and that's only so they have the ability to disable the content freeze. The admin should still not make any changes.
